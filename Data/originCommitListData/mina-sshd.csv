The setting was not considered in password authentication, and in
keyboard-interactive authentication counted the number of non-empty
challenges, which could lead to an extra authentication request
message to be sent, or to keyboard-interactive authentication being
aborted too early.

The property is supposed to correspond to the OpenSSH configuration
NumberOfPasswordPrompts, which despite the name counts not the number
of prompts but the number of times password or keyboard-interactive
authentication is attempted. For password authentication, this is
the same (if one ignores possible password-change requests), but in
keyboard-interactive authentication, there may be several prompts
per attempt.

Fix the implementation in Apache MINA sshd to respect the limit in
both password and keyboard-interactive authentication, and in both
apply the limit to the count of interactive authentication attempts.

If password identities are provided on a session non-interactively
(via addPasswordIdentity(), or via a custom PasswordIdentityProvider
set with setPasswordIdentityProvider()), any authentication attempts
that are answered non-interactively do not count towards the limit.

Automatically configure KeyIdentityProviders to use the
FilePasswordProvider set on the client if they don't have an explicit
password provider already.

This simplifies setting up a client to deal with encrypted private
keys: set a FilePasswordProvider on the client, and set a
FileKeyPairProvider with the key file(s), and off it goes.

Previously, setting a FilePasswordProvider on an SshClient only had
an effect for identity files specified in a HostConfigEntry. For other
use cases, a FilePasswordProvider had to be set explicitly on the
FileKeyPairProvider. (Which is still possible, and takes precedence
over the new auto-configuration.)

This also makes it possible to use SshClientMain with an encrypted
private key given on the command-line via the -i option.

The previous implementation would always reset the window to the
maximum size when it had dropped to below half the maximum size.

This was wrong and defeated the purpose of having a window. The
window size is reduced upon reception of the data, and incremented
when the reader from the channel has read some data. With a slow
reader and a fast sender, the window would be opened fully even if
the reader had not read the previously accumulated data. As a result,
internal buffers could exceed the window size by a lot.

(Consider the very good description in ChannelDataReceiver: if the
exit toll booth always tells the entry the bridge was free again,
far too many cars would be let onto the bridge. With a real bridge,
there'd be a gigantic traffic jam; with Apache MINA sshd, the bridge
(the internal buffers) would just get longer and longer.)

Change the algorithm to increase the window size only by as much as
has actually been read by the channel reader. Use the same logic as
OpenSSH: send a window adjustment message when the available size is
smaller than half the full window size, or if more than three full SSH
packets have been buffered.

To avoid sending a window adjustment for very small amounts, require
a minimum size for the adjustment (more than half a packet, or more
than a tenth of the full window, or more than 16kB -- because packet
size and full window size are configurable, a single minimum value is
not good enough.)

If there are multiple threads reading (for instance, one from stdout
and one from stderr), make sure that normally only one will cause a
window adjustment to be sent.",

With trace logging on, sensitive data in keyboard-interactive or in
password user authentication ended up being logged via two paths both
in a client or in a server.

In a client:
- when logging outgoing packets just before they are encrypted
- when logging challenge responses in keyboard-interactive auth

In a server:
- when logging incoming packets just after having been decrypted
- when logging received challenge responses (keyboard-interactive auth)

Avoid this by not logging raw packet contents for
SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST and SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_INFO_RESPONSE. In the
client, log challenge responses with echo=false as ""(hidden)"", and in
the server don't log the received challenge responses at all, only
their number.

All these log messages are active only for trace logging, which is
intended for detailed debugging. There is no reason to use trace
logging on a production instance (it also may impact performance
quite negatively).",SSHD-1315

Apparently it is possible on Windows that the ACL for a file have no
entry for the file owner. (Typically the owner is then member of a
group, and there is an entry for the group.) The previous code would in
such cases remove all access permissions from all entries, resulting in
a file that even the owner could no longer access.

Change the logic: not only remove all permissions for non-owner entries
but also add an explicit entry for the owner, giving it full access
permissions.

This rolls back the changes made in ClientConnectionService in commit

Session.request() because heartbeats are not sent from I/O threads.

However, commit de2f8fef broke the contract specified in interface
Session, which says Session.request() must return ""the buffer if the
request was successful, {@code null} otherwise."" The implementation
from commit de2f8fef threw an exception instead.

This was wrong, and is corrected now in this commit. Note that this
means that a caller cannot distinguish between the server replying

When channel data is received, the window size must be decremented right
away. If we do this only once we've processed the received data, it's
possible that we buffer a lot data if the peer (by mistake or malicious
intent) ignores our window and just keeps on sending data.

However, sending back a SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_WINDOW_ADJUST message must
occur only after the received data has been processed or forwarded.

Make Window an abstract class, and have two concrete subclasses for
RemoteWindow and LocalWindow. This is safer, since we should never call
check() on a remote window, or expand() on a local window. Also, do not
let Window implement java.nio.channel.Channel. Just because it has a
close() and an isOpen() method, a Window is not a channel.

Change all uses appropriately and replace all calls to consumeAndCheck()
by check(). In AbstractChannel, call consume() right away when data is
received on the SSH channel.

Refactor the way a channel's writePacket() method decides whether to
write a packet. Introduce a new mayWrite() method so that less
overriding in subclasses of AbstractChannel is needed when asynchronous
streams are needed. (In that case, there may be pending writes that may
need to be flushed, so writing must not stop on isClosing() but only on
isClosed().)",

The output stream on the socket should not be shut down immediately but
only once already pending writes have been done. This is already the
case with the MINA and Netty transport back-ends, which only schedule a
shutdown request on their write queue.

Closing them when the channel closes leads to the strange situation
that the application reads from an already closed InputStream. That's
not a good idea.

It's the caller's responsibility to close the input stream obtained
from Channel.getInvertedOut() or getInvertedErr(). And of course it
should do so only after it has read all the data it wanted, and the
channel is closed.

It's not a real problem if the stream is not closed (for instance, if
the application never even called getInvertedOut() and never read
anything). Closing doesn't do much anyway except awaking a potentially
waiting read() call. Moreover, if the channel is short-lived and didn't
transmit a lot of data, the application may well start reading from the
stream only after the underlying SSH channel is already closed.

One problem with this ChannelPipedInputStream is that it may buffer up
to a full SSH channel window. If the window size is large, that may
consume a lot of memory if the application only reads infrequently (or
doesn't read at all). However, not reading from such a stream is bad
practice anyway if there is any chance that there might be a substantial
amount of data; as with processes, it may lead to a blocked execution
when buffers fill up or the channel window is exhausted.",SSHD-1302

Remove the option not to send a chunk when the remote window is
smaller than the packet size, and we're trying to write more than
the remote window size bytes. This option may lead to hangs with
peers that wait with sending their window adjustment until the window
size is very low, or even zero.

RFC 4254 does not mandate any particular point at which an SSH
implementation should send a window adjustment. Implementations
doing so only once the window has been fully consumed are well
within the bounds of the specification.

Therefore remove this option altogether, and always send some data
if the window size is > 0. Refactor the writePacket() method to make
it much simpler and clearer.

The load tests do run fine with Apache MINA. But enabling them

re-write of TCP/IP port forwarding. Commit b91a4245 changed the port
forwarding such that it disabled reads on the I/O port session
(IoSession.suspendRead()) while writing to the SSH tunnel, and re-
enabling reads (IoSession.resumeRead()) once the write was complete.
This avoids the need to buffer data inside Apache MINA; it throttles
reading from the port to the speed of writing through the tunnel.

This works fine with the NIO2 and Netty transports, but with Apache
MINA re-enabling reads becomes effective only on the next select call.
If a select call was already on-going, re-enabling reading might become
effective only after one second (the MINA idle time-out on the select).

Fix this by forcing an on-going select call to return immediately when
reading on a MINA IoSession is re-enabled. Apache MINA thus picks up

Apache MINA manages the read buffer size dynamically and adapts the
buffer size in the range from 64 bytes to 64kB, starting at 2kB. Give
users a way to influence this a little: use the NIO2_READ_BUFFER_SIZE
also in MINA for the initial buffer size, and add a new property
MIN_READ_BUFFER_SIZE to change the lower limit.

Then use these properties to make the tests previously disabled for
MINA in ApacheServerApacheClientTest and in ApacheServerJSchClientTest
work also for MINA by enforcing a minimum read buffer size of 32kB.

The NIO2_READ_BUFFER_SIZE property has _not_ been renamed, and its
property key has been left unchanged to not cause surprises for
existing clients using it, possibly via a system property.

Note that the NIO2 transport uses the default defined in
CoreModuleProperties (32kB) if the property is not set explicitly.
The MINA transport uses these properties only if set explicitly,
otherwise the MINA default behavior is effective.

The Netty transport uses neither property; read buffer management in
Netty works completely differently (via RecvByteBufAllocator).",

Make sure that a thread does not try to acquire the write lock if
it already holds the read lock. This could happen if a write is not
enqueued and there is an exception during writing, and we then try
to close the session on the same thread.

The read/write lock is used for three purposes: first, it gives the
flushing thread trying to empty the queue of pending packets priority
over other threads trying to enqueue more packets, and second, it is
held during writeOrEnqueue() while writing a packet directly to prevent
that the KEX state changes between being checked and the write being
done, and third, to prevent that the KEX state changes asynchronously
while the flushing thread is checking it. The read/write lock itself
does not serve to ensure mutual exclusion on the KEX state itself.

These three functions can also be fulfilled if update() is executed
when only the read lock is held. If a thread in update() holds the read
lock, this can only occur if it wrote the buffer directly in
writeOrEnqueue(), in which case it is fine to proceed, and the flushing
thread for sure is not in its critical region where it holds the write
lock. Otherwise, any other thread either is the flushing thread and
holds the write lock already, or it's a thread not holding the lock at
all. In both cases it is fine to acquire the write lock.",SSHD-1289

Handling of global requests with want-reply=true was synchronous. This
is fine if the call is made on a non-I/O thread, but to be able to use
global requests in I/O threads, an asynchronous handling is needed.

Provide an asynchronous variant of Session.request() that returns a
future and that takes an optional reply handler as argument. If a
handler is given, it will be invoked by the framework once the reply
is received, on the I/O thread that received the reply. The future can
in this case be used to wait until the request has indeed be sent.
Without handler, the future can be used to await the reply on some
other thread, or to handle it via a future listener.

This makes global request handling much more flexible, avoids that a
synchronous implementation blocks an I/O thread, and it avoids problems
with making global requests while a key exchange is ongoing.

It also removes the restriction that there must be only one pending
global request per SSH session. The implementation keeps a FIFO list
of requests sent, and associates a reply with the front-most request
in that list. Only requests with want-reply=true enter that list.

Because of SSHD-968 we must also know the SSH message sequence number
of each global request made with want-reply=true. The previous
implementation assumed that the when a request was made, the next
packet written would be that request. But that may not be true when a
KEX is ongoing. Improve that implementation to report the sequence
number via a callback when the request's packet is indeed sent.

In AbstractSession.preClose(), fail all pending global requests.

Additionally, make Session.request() also work for global requests with
want-reply=false. Such requests can also be written directly with
Session.writePacket(), but it seems natural and convenient for users
of the library to also be able to use Session.request() for this.

Add some fairly advanced unit tests to verify the implementation. The
new unit tests showcase different implementations, somewhat simplified,
of a client-side OpenSshHostKeysHandler.

Add some technical documentation on global requests.",

TCP/IP port forwarding started reading on the local port before the SSH
tunnel was established, i.e., before SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION
was received. It buffered data until then, and then tried to flush the
buffer once the confirmation was received.

This didn't work if the channel window was exhausted while that buffered
data was to be written, and in particular it failed when the channel was
opened with an initial window size of zero.

Change the whole forwarding setup: first set up the SSH tunnel, only
then start reading from the local port. That way, no data needs to be
buffered at all.

Use a ChannelAsyncOutputStream to forward data read into the SSH tunnel;
this nicely adapts to the channel window. To avoid concurrent writes on
this channel, suspend reading from the local port before writing, and
resume it only after the data was written. This automatically throttles
reading to the speed of writing, which is what one wants in this case.

Implement IOSession.suspendRead() and IOSession.resumeRead() also for
the MINA and Netty back-ends. Fix the implementation for the NIO2
back-end: the former implementation of resumeRead() could cause
concurrent reads if the channel indeed did an asynchronous read, and if
the channel did a synchronous read it led to deep completion handler
chains on the stack, and could delay the next read on some other
session's completion handler. Resolve this for our use-case by
scheduling an asynchronous read explicitly if necessary, and letting
the normal read completion handler do the read if possible.

Do this also for the TcpipServerChannel: it started reading from the
connected port before it even sent SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION.
Remove the BufferedIoOutputStream and use a ChannelAsyncOutputStream
always.

Run the forwarding writes through ThreadUtils.runAsInternal(): the
write might otherwise block if a KEX was on-going, but we should never
block NIO threads. With ThreadUtils.runAsInternal(), the write may
enqueue a packet, but the write future will be fulfilled only once this
enqueued packet was flushed when KEX is done, so we won't read from the
port until then and thus don't run the risk that a fast producer puts
thousands of packets onto the internal queue during KEX.

Fix a bug in AbstractChannel that became apparent with this change: when
a peer disconnects before having sent SSH_MSG_OPEN_CONFIRMATION for a
channel, that channel cannot be closed gracefully because the peer's id
for it is unknown.

Include technical documentation on TCP/IP port forwarding.",SSHD-1262

Running the tests with Netty frequently resulted in failures due to
connection time-outs. The root cause of this was a race condition
in NettyIoConnector: if the connection succeeded and the NettyIoSession
was initialized via channelActive() before the connector had set
the DefaultIoConnectFuture attribute on the channel, then that future
would never be signalled.

Rewrite the NettyIoConnector to not use a global Bootstrap for all
connections. Use a new and dedicated Bootstrap per connection. This
makes is possible to use Bootstrap.attr() to have the channel attribute
be set early on, before even the connection is attempted. For the
context AttributeRepository, one then doesn't even need an attribute;
it's available directly.

Also don't set SO_BACKLOG in the connector; this socket option only
makes sense for server sockets, i.e., in the acceptor.

flight"" before the peer's KEX_INIT. A potential service accept message
to send back will be delayed until after the KEX. If no KEX was run yet,
refuse the service request.

Do the same also for SSH_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT.

This change uncovered a bug in ClientUserAuthService, which suddenly
sent the SSH_MSG_USER_AUTH 'none' before the SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST
'user-auth'. This happened because SSH_MSG_USER_AUTH got written before
the service was even started; the message got queued, and flushing the
queue starts now before KEX state done. Until now this was hidden
because SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST was written on the KeyEstablished event
and was treated as a low-level message, and thus got sent before
flushing the queue started.

Fix this by delaying sending SSH_MSG_USER_AUTH until the service has
indeed been started (and the SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST has been sent).

Include some documentation on KEX.",

Previous code flushed them synchronously before setting KEX state to
DONE. This could lead to deadlocks if there were exceptions and the
session got closed while flushing.

Moreover, AbstractSession.writePacket() had a race condition: after
having determined the kex state, it was still possible that an incoming
SSH_MSG_KEX_INIT would change the KEX state and then get the encodeLock
and send back its answer before the first thread. In that case the
client might have received a high-level message during KEX, which is
forbidden by RFC 4253.

Change the code to flush pending packets asynchronously. In
writePackets, keep enqueuing packets if KEX is DONE but we're still
flushing. To avoid keeping the flushing thread busy forever, we block
new writes, unless they are direct replies to SSH protocol messages.
I.e., channel data messages block the calling thread while flushing
is still in progress.

Some care has to be exercised to avoid new deadlocks. First, obviously
a thread holding the decodeLock must not be blocked. Second, threads
holding the futureLock must never block. Additionally, the code never
blocks writes that occur inside a future listener.

Note that while KEX is in progress (not DONE yet), an application may
put arbitrarily many packets onto the queue (for instance, if the
remote's channel window is large, and there's an asynchronous
application thread pumping data through a channel). This was the case
already before this change, and it is still the case. If there is so
much data in the queue that a new KEX will be triggered, the new code
will actually initiate a new KEX, flushing stops, and is resumed once
the new KEX finishes.",SSHD-966

Allow closing a ChannelOutputStream asynchronously. The broad
synchronization on the stream instance's monitor in both write() and
flush() was the immediate cause of the deadlock reported in SSHD-966.

The Apache MINA sshd framework needs to be able to asynchronously
close a ChannelOutputStream when there are errors and the session
is shut down on exceptions.

The only synchronized method is now write(), and synchronization is
used solely to prevent concurrent writes. The state shared between
write() and flush() (the buffer state) is guarded separately, and is
never locked while waiting for window adjustments or while writing.",Fine-

Remove the broad locking on the stream instance's monitor. Holding
such broad locks during write operations may easily deadlock. Instead
guard only some state fields, and make sure these are never locked
during write operations, or when futures are fulfilled, which may
notify arbitrary listeners, which might trigger writes.

The idea of this ChannelAsyncOutputStream is to write as much of a
buffer as possible as individual packets. When there is not enough
window space, stop writing and let the write be resumed asynchronously
once the window has been enlarged; then write the rest of the buffer.

The implementation treats the buffer to be written as a token: while
it is being processed, the pendingWrite field is null. This ensures
that always only one thread is processing the buffer to write the next
chunk. Otherwise it might be possible that an asynchronous window
adjustment tried to process the buffer while it already was being
written.

Closing a ChannelAsyncOutputStream gracefully is tricky and may not
always be possible, depending on the reason for closing it. If channel
window adjustments are not handled anymore, writing the last pending
buffer in full may not be possible if the stream is waiting for more
window space. In that case, the stream may close with some unwritten
data, but that is unavoidable. (The previous code had a similar problem;
see SSHD-1261; this implementation should also solve that issue.)",Fine-

Reset the list when a new key is tried to avoid inadvertently trying
a remaining signature algorithm from a previous failed authentication
attempt.

The test reproduces the authentication failure (without the fix), but
it cannot reproduce the exact exception reported in SSHD-1231. With an
Apache MINA sshd server, the InvalidKey exception occurs on the server
side, and the client just gets a ""no more authentication methods""
exception. This is because our server verifies the signature algorithm
against the key type before even checking whether the key would be
acceptable at all. (It sets up a signature verifier even if the request
does not contain a signature.) OpenSSH checks the key against the
authorized keys first, and thus the InvalidKey exception occurs in the
client.",SSHD-1231

was that the fingerprint was reported as ""BufferException"". (Supporting

Refactor the reading and writing of FileTimes to avoid manual nanosecond

reading, drop nanos if the value would be outside the range of Instant.

The advantage of doing it this way is that we can actually report and
recover sub-millisecond timestamps (for SFTP version >= 4). Newer Java
does report file timestamps with the OS resolution (100ns on Windows/

Simplify MontgomeryCurve, take advantage of the fact that the key is
always the last 32 or 56 bytes of the X.509 DER encoding. Add extensive
comments about the ""magic"" constants. Be more strict about key data
with an extra leading zero byte.

Enable the new KEX algorithms in BaseBuilder.

At that point, curve25519 KEX worked only if both the client's and the
server's ephemeral public keys byte arrays did not have the most
significant bit in the first byte set. This uncovered a bug in DHGClient
and DHGServer: ECDH and XDH KEX encode Q_C and Q_S as plain byte arrays,
not as multi-precision integers. I.e., they _do not_ prefix a zero byte
if the high bit in the first byte of the value is set.

Fix this by introducing AbstractDH.putE(Buffer) and putF(Buffer)
methods, so that individual DH implementations can override as
appropriate. Override them for ECDH and XDH to write byte arrays, not
mpints.

* RFC 4253, section 8:[1] encodes e and f as mpint.
* RFC 5656, section 4:[2] Q_C and Q_S, which take the place of e and f,
  are written as ""strings"" (byte arrays).
* RFC 8731, section 3:[3] Public ephemeral keys are written as strings.

With these changes, KEX using curve25519 works, and KEX using one of
the other already existing algorithms also still works.

This greatly reduces the number of (L)STAT calls made to get SFTP
attributes. Also, listing directories in reply to SSH_FXP_OPENDIR
and SSH_FXP_READDIR can in this way still go through the normal
`java.nio.file.FileSystem` abstraction. There is no need anymore to
bypass the file system to resolve SSHD-1217.

The attributes cached on the `Path` objects returned from the
`DirectoryStream` are used only for listing the directory. This
is a similar optimization as was done in the Java libraries for
a `FileTreeWalker` operating on an Unix file system, which may use
cached attributes via the internal interface
`sun.nio.fs.BasicFileAttributesHolder`.

Caching is also enabled selectively in the up-front checks for file
accessibility, which also caused repeated (L)STAT calls. Rewrite
`IoUtils.checkFileExists()` to load attributes only once.

The new operations for caching attributes on `SftpPath` instances are
not intended to be used by client code. For access in the SFTP
implementation itself, paths are now always created as `SftpPathImpl`
instances, which inherit from `SftpPath` and publish a safe
`withAttributeCache()` method. Theoretically client code could
still access these methods, but then it's clear for everyone that these
are internal operations.",SSHD-1220

An Apache MINA sshd SFTP server configured to use an SftpFileSystem
pointing to yet another SFTP server would serve directory listings
only very slowly.

This was caused by the SFTP server implementation using Java FileSystem
abstractions itself for listing directories. Using java.nio.file.Files,
it ended up doing essentially the following when receiving a
SSH_FXP_READDIR command:

```
try(DirectoryStream<Path> list = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir)) {
  Map<Path, BasicFileAttributes> toSend = new HashMap<>();
  list.iterator().forEach(p ->
    toSend.put(p, Files.readAttributes(p, BasicFileAttributes.class))
  );
  replyToClient(SSH_FXP_NAME, toSend);
};
```
(Not literally. This omits a lot of special handling for empty
directories, not sending too large messages back to the client, and
so on. But ultimately it boiled down to the above.)

That is fine when the server-side file system from which files are
served is local on the server. But when that file system itself is
a remote file system, `newDirectoryStream` is a remote call sending
SSH_FXP_OPENDIR and SSH_FXP_READDIR to the upstream server, and
additionally each of these `readAttributes()` calls is yet another
remote call sending SSH_FXP_LSTAT. This slows down getting the
directory listing to the client tremendously.

The most annoying part of all this is that the SSH_FXP_READDIR to the
upstream SFTP server in `newDirectoryStream` _already returned all the
attributes_, but this is lost because the Java NIO File abstractions
have no real support for getting a directory listing including
attributes in one fell swoop. (No, using a FileVisitor and
Files.walkFileTree with depth 1 wouldn't help.)

So detect this case in the server's SftpSubsystem, and bypass the Java
FileSystem abstraction if the file system is itself an SftpFileSystem.
Simply issue SSH_FXP_READDIR requests and forward the whole reply, which
includes file names and attributes, directly to the client. For reading
a directory containing 2000 files, this eliminates 10040 SSH_FXP_LSTAT
calls; only the directory itself is stat'ed.

A corollary to this is that clients in general should avoid listing
directories on an SftpFileSystem via java.nio.file.Files _if they also
need the file attributes_. Instead do

```
SftpFileSystem fs = ...;
try (SftpClient client = fs.getClient();
     CloseableHandle dir = client.openDir(remDirPath)) {
  for (SftpClient.DirEntry entry : client.listDir(dir)) {
    Path path = dir.getFile().resolve(entry.getFilename());
    SftpClient.Attributes = entry.getAttributes();
    // Do whatever you need with it
  }
}
```

Implementation note: another idea is to cache the attributes read in
SSH_FXP_READDIR in `newDirectoryStream` on the Path objects returned,
and make `readAttributes` return these cached attributes while the
stream is not closed yet. Technically, this is doable; it'd be a hack
similar to what Java's own UnixFileSystem does (and FileVisitor takes
advantage of it). However, it would break some edge cases, like a
client writing to one of the files during the directory stream
iteration, and then reading the attributes again and expecting the
new attributes but still getting the cached ones.

Side note: the SFTP protocol has no command to get _only_ a listing
of names. SSH_FXP_READDIR _always_ returns both names and attributes.",SSHD-1217

Provide a default implementation for the server-side SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO
message sending including the server-sig-algs KEX extension.[1]

A server that implements the rsa-sha2-512 or rsa-sha2-256 signature
algorithms should implement this extension, otherwise even clients that
also have these signature algorithms may fall back to ssh-rsa to avoid
authentication penalties.[2]

Apache MINA sshd servers by default do implement the SHA-2 RSA
signatures, and an Apache MINA sshd client by default does request KEX
extension information and does handle the server-sig-algs extension. So
an Apache MINA sshd server should by default implement this extension.

This implementation sends the server-sig-algs extension record once at
the end of the initial key exchange.

Some SFTP clients in SFTP version >= V5 set the NFS desired-access flag
ACE4_APPEND_DATA even when they only open the file for normal write
access. SFTP append mode should be active only if the file is indeed
opened with one of the ""append"" options SSH_FXF_APPEND or
SSH_FXF_APPEND_DATA or SSH_FXF_APPEND_DATA_ATOMIC.

The SFTP draft RFCs appear to allow the combination of SSH_FXF_READ,
SSH_FXF_WRITE, and SSH_FXF_APPEND, which would open the file for reading
and writing, all writes going to the current end of the file. POSIX
also allows the combination O_RDWR | O_APPEND. But Java complains about
using both StandardOpenOption.READ and StandardOpenOption.APPEND.
Therefore never open files in Java with StandardOpenOption.APPEND but
always manage the ""append"" logic explicitly. Internally, make sure that
ACE4_APPEND_DATA is set only if the user/client had indeed requested
""append"" mode.",SSHD-1215

If the target already exists, a plain rename must fail. For SFTP >= V5,
a rename with CopyMode.Overwrite shall succeed. Note that the behavior

java.nio.file.Files.move() with StandardCopyOption.ATOMIC_MOVE, for

""If the target file exists then it is implementation specific if
the existing file is replaced or this method fails by throwing an

There was a window in AbstractSession.requestNewKeyExchange()
during which the KEX state was set already to INIT, but the
caller's proposal not set yet. If the peer had also decided to
start a new key exchange, it was possible that the peer's KEX_INIT
message arrived and was handled in that window and then proceeded
with wrong or uninitialized data.

KEX negotiation must start only when both proposals are indeed
available. Thus wait when having received a KEX_INIT from the peer
until our own proposal has been prepared before continuing with the
negotiation.

There's a new CoreModuleProperties.KEX_PROPOSAL_SETUP_TIMEOUT property
for controlling the timeout for this waiting. Since it's used at a
moment when there is already a thread running to prepare our proposal,
we should never have to wait for long; the property should be set to a
reasonably high value such that the timeout is never hit. A minimum
value for this timeout of 5 seconds is enforced.",SSHD-1197

Add a unit test exercising authentication with all supported *-cert
key types against a real OpenSSH server run in a docker container.

The OpenSSH server runs in an Alpine container and is primed with two
host keys, selectable via an environment variable, and two users. It
supports pubkey and password authentication.

The test case uses org.testcontainers to build a cached docker image
and to run and teardown the docker container instance. The test uses
the Apache MINA sshd client using client certificate keys to
authenticate at the OpenSSH server in the docker container.

The test is not run with the mina and netty back-ends; testcontainers
has problems resolving files when run from the re-usable test JAR. It
also isn't run on Windows; GitHub actions Windows Server VM's don't
have Docker (Linux) support.

Also note that the test makes sure that the real BouncyCastle security
provider is installed; testcontainers contains a shaded BC copy that
may fail at runtime due to being unsigned.",SSHD-1161

SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK is supposed to say ""the server will accept the
key and signature algorithm the client sent in the previous
SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message"". It is _not_ intended as a mechanism
for the server to override the client's choice of algorithm.

See RFC 4252.[1]

Just log a warning if a server sends back an unexpected ""algorithm"".
(Github's SSH-2.0-babeld-383743ad was found to reply ""ssh-rsa"" even
if the client requested ""rsa-sha2-512"" and the server had previously
announced via server-sig-algs that it supports rsa-sha2-512. Subsequent
authentication with rsa-sha2-512 then still works.)

Of course the returned public key must still match exactly.

The client always uses the signature algorithm that it had announced
it would use.

Unconditionally announce that the client wants to get the server's
SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO. Otherwise the server will never send it. Add the
""ext-info-c"" marker only on the very first key exchange proposal,
and make sure the client doesn't send by mistake ""ext-info-s"".

KexExtensions are available in all phases except PREKEX.

When server-sig-algs is received, reorder the client session's
signature factories such that algorithms the server announced as
supported come first, followed by those not announced, both in client
order.

The client determines the order and the server just says what it
supports.

Note that per RFC 8308 [1] it's possible that a server doesn't announce
_all_ the algorithms it supports, and a client is allowed to try
unsupported algorithms, but may face authentication penalties such
as back-off delays, authentication failures, or disconnections.

Make ClientSessionImpl.authFuture volatile since it may be accessed by
different threads without synchronization.

Remove the initial dummy AuthFuture that served only to record an early
exception, and to provide a correct session state in waitFor() when KEX
was done but auth() not called yet.

Record exceptions from signalAuthFailure() in a list if there's no
AuthFuture yet. Introduce a lock for guarding the authFuture field and
this new list of exceptions together.

The access in updateCurrentSessionState() must remain unsynchronized
because it occurs while the futureLock is held. Synchronizing there
on errorLock might introduce a lock inversion between that access in
updateCurrentSessionState() (lock order futureLock-errorLock), but
the call to authService.auth() inside ClientSessionImpl.auth() has the
potential to also access the futureLock is there was a previous future,
which might give the lock order errorLock-futureLock.

Listeners futures are always called outside the future's lock, so even
if a listener calls auth() or signalAuthFailure(), this will
not cause a lock inversion.",SSHD-1050

Add support for writing keys in the modern OpenSSH key format using
the OpenBSD bcrypt KDF for writing passphrase-protected, encrypted
private keys.

Add a new OpenSSHKeyPairResourceWriter using a specialized
OpenSSHKeyEncryptionContext to make the number of KDF rounds
configurable and to have the passphrase as a char[] instead of as a
String. Introduce a new SecureByteArrayOutputStream.

Includes test cases that generate various keys, write them to files,
and load them again. Since this only tests that Apache MINA sshd can
work with these keys, I've also manually verified that command-line
OpenSSH can use keys generated and written by Java to actually connect
to an SSH server.",SSHD-984

If a subsystem is disabled the server won't be able to create
the subsystem command object and initialize it into the channel.
A SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE is returned to the client, but the
client may have already started to send data for this command.

In the case of the sftp there is an initial data packet
sent by the client immediately behind the channel request,
so the ChannelSession needs to consume this requset even if it
no subsystem command was created.  Eventually the client will
receive the SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE that was sent, and tear down
the connection with a failure message.

If the window has no more free space, we can't flush any more data
until we receive a window adjust from the peer and get more space.

If we still have data to write, but there is no data in our local
buffer, we can't rely on flush() to wait for the window to get more
free space.  Calling flush would do nothing, and we'd spin in a hard
loop without releasing the processor until the window adjust came in.

Instead of spinning, fall sleep on the Window until there is at
least one byte free for us to write into.

The only way for this case to arise is for both lastSize and
bufferLength to be equal to 0, and for the Window to have no space.
This can only happen if the application has written sufficient data
to one OutputStream (stdout or SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_DATA) to cause the
Window to have no space, and then it performs the first write on
the other OutputStream (stderr or SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA).

This can happen if the first stream throws an exception, and the
application catches it and tries to print the stack trace to the
second stream.

When the 2nd output stream starts its first write, both lastSize and
bufferLength are 0 as we have never sent a packet from this stream.
We spin hard in the write-flush loop, and never actually fall asleep
to wait for the window adjust.

During flush we invoke newBuffer() to ensure that the Buffer we pass
down into the outgoing encode and transmit queue is independent of
the Buffer we continue to use for subsequently written data.

However, there is no need to invoke newBuffer() again at the end
of the flush method.

If the method completes normally, the loop broke out because the
bufferLength member is equal to 0, which means the current Buffer
instance is in use only by ourselves, and is empty.  We don't need
to allocate yet another empty Buffer to replace it.

If the method crashes due to an exception, we have only two cases
to worry about:

  case 1:  before the newBuffer call

  In this case, the only state changes we have done is to write
  the current buffer length into the existing Buffer instance.
  Nobody else has our Buffer.  If we crash with a RuntimeException
  during this phase and come back here again during a future write
  we'll just overwrite the same section with a new length.

  case 2:  after the newBuffer call

  After the newBuffer invocation we could crash while trying to
  send the old Buffer out.  We've already replaced the Buffer with
  a fresh one, so all that happens is the old Buffer gets garbage
  collected, possibly causing a gap in the application data stream.

So this use of newBuffer during the finally is unnecessary and
is not needed to ensure our future instance state is sane if an
exception occurs.

MINA itself is actually forcing the receive buffer size to be 1024
bytes, rather than the operating system default.  By default the
NioAcceptor is created with a DefaultSocketSessionConfig [1] which
sets both the send and receive buffer sizes to 1024 bytes.

NioSocketAcceptor [2] then turns around and sets this receive
buffer size into the accept socket, so all child sockets created
for incoming connections inherit this low default value.

However, in the case of the send buffer, because the configured
value of 1024 matches the default of 1024 for the send buffer,
doSetAll [3] never actually changes the send buffer size away from
the operating system default.

Unfortunately this means we have the following situation for our
NIO based sockets:

       MINA  | OS Default
      +------+-----------
  RCV | 1024 | 43690
  SND | 8192 |  8192

So the receive buffer size under MINA is 42x smaller than the OS
default.  But the send buffer size is the OS default, as MINA does
not directly set the send buffer size itself.  So send throughput
is actually reasonable, but receive throughput is horrible.

There is a good article [4] which explains how these settings impact
connection throughput.  If we want any decent TCP/IP throughput we
need reasonably large buffers to increase the amount of data one
side can send before stopping and waiting for an ACK from the peer.
If our receive window is only 1024 bytes, our peer can't even send
a full TCP/IP packet on Ethernet without stopping and waiting for
an ACK from us.

Of course one could try to argue that the MINA default of 1024 bytes
for the receive buffer is suitable, especially on a server with a
very large number of idle connections, or connections where a human
is typing all of the input data. But it is not suitable for a high
traffic data receiver, like the scp command.

Unfortunately asking applications to raise the receive buffer size
on each individual connection through the SessionFactory doesn't
work on all platforms.  On Linux with OpenJDK 6 the following
application code appears to work:

  setSessionFactory(new SessionFactory() {
      @Override
      protected ServerSession createSession(final IoSession io)
          throws Exception {
          final SocketSessionConfig c = (SocketSessionConfig) io.getConfig();
          c.setKeepAlive(keepAlive);
          c.setReceiveBufferSize(43690);
        }
    }
  });

but the aggregate throughput is still horrible (3 MB/s).  So the
receive buffer didn't actually increase with the peer.

Linux seems to be capping the connection at the upper bound when
the connection starts.  If we set the receive buffer size of the
NioSocketAcceptor to 43690, later drop the receive buffer size of
the individual connection to 1024 in the session factory, we can
later boost it when a specific command starts, and performance
behaves as expected.

To match developer expectations we now reset the receive buffer
size to the operating system's default size before the server
starts accepting connections.  This allows applications to get good
throughput by default, or raise/lower the receive buffer within
reasonable limits based on the command executed.

packet size or the current free window space, whichever limit is

send it immediately to the peer.

By sizing the buffer during write() to fit the available window
space we significantly reduce the chances that a buffer split and
copy is needed during flush().  However, a buffer split could still
occur if different threads are writing to two different streams on
the same channel (e.g. one thread is writing to the stdout stream
and a different thread is writing on the stderr stream).

During write() we give ourselves a credit equal to the size of
the last packet we successfully wrote out of this channel stream.
This allows the application producer to race ahead of the network
handshake by one packet and produce more data while waiting for
the handshake to free up window space.

up to approximately the same size before we are forced to trigger
another flush.  So allocate the next buffer sized to hold the last
packet's complete length, or the data remaining if we had to split
the buffered packet to fit into the available window space.

Unfortunately most uses of createBuffer don't care about the size
of the buffer, as they are one-shot requests which are often within

permit turning trace on dynamically without having a per-connection
filter to control which sessions are traced, and which are not.
